#' Download requested plant occurrence data for Norway from GBIF
#' 
#' This function downloads and unzips GBIF data that has been previously 
#' requested under a specified download key into a user-specified directory.
#' 
#' The procedure is based on the extensively commented instructions for
#' asynchronous downloading of GBIF data by Anders Finstad, available here:
#' https://gbif-europe.github.io/nordic_oikos_2018_r/s3_gbif_demo/3.x_async_download_gbif.Rmd
#' This allows downloading larger data sets, and citation of the download with 
#' a single doi. 
#' 
#' Note that after running `getKey_GBIF` to obtain the download key, you need 
#' to wait until GBIF has readied your dataset before you run `downloadData_GBIF`. 
#' 
#' @param key A character string representing a download key. Obtained via the
#' `getKey_GBIF` function, but can also be set manually if required.
#' 
#' @param path Directory into which GBIF data should be downloaded. 
#'
#' @return A dataframe containing downloaded GBIF occurrence records.
#' @export
